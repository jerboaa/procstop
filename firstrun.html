	<h1>ProcSTOP Getting Started Guide</h1>
	<h2>What is ProcSTOP?</h2>
	<p>

		ProcSTOP is an extension for Google Chrome which tries to help
		you with getting better at managing your time which you spend
		casually browsing the Web.

	</p>
	<h2>How does ProcSTOP work?</h2>
	<h3>Browsing Time Awareness Training</h3>
	<p>

		The idea of ProcSTOP is to playfully train you to get better at
		estimating the time you spend online. By doing so it aims to
		increase awareness of the actual time a user spends online. We
		try to achieve this by allowing users to regain control over
		how they want to use their spare time and perhaps their
		productive hours as well.

	</p>
	<p>

		ProcSTOP sets up a timer which expires randomly within a given
		range. Once the timer expires the user is notified by a pop-up
		notification and a flashing add-on icon.

	</p>
	<h3>Taking a Break from Browsing by Doing a Stretch</h3>
	<p>

		Then, the user has the possibility to see their actual online
		time. But before users get to see that they are encouraged to
		take a step back, relax, get their thoughts off what they were
		currently doing by showing a fitness video with instructions as
		to how to stretch their back. The idea of this is to get the
		sole attention of the user for a couple of minutes.

	</p>
	<h3>Guessing Game</h3>
	<p>

		Next, the user will be asked to guess their time they think
		they have spent online since they clicked the "Start" button of
		the add-on. In the next step the actual guessing time is shown
		and the actual time spent online on that day is recorded.

	</p>
	<h3>Satisfaction with Actual Time Spent Browsing</h3>
	<p>

		In the final step the user is asked for their level of
		satisfaction with the time they actually spent online. The
		add-on keeps a history of this measure of satisfaction together
		with the time spent online.
